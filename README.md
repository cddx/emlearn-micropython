# emlearn-micropython

Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing for [MicroPython](https://micropython.org).
Provides convenient and efficient MicroPython modules, and enables MicroPython application developers
to run efficient Machine Learning models on microcontroller, without having to touch any C code.

This is a [TinyML](https://www.tinyml.org/) library,
particularly well suited for low-compexity and low-power classification tasks.
It can be combined with feature preprocessing, including neural networks to address more complex tasks.

Builds on [emlearn](https://emlearn.org), a C99 library for Machine Learning on microcontrollers and embedded system.

> scikit-learn for Microcontrollers

## Status
**Minimally useful**

- Tested *working* on `x64` (Unix port) and `xtensawin` (ESP32).
- Currently *broken* on ARM `armv6m` (Cortex M0 / RP2040). [Issue](https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython/issues/19)

## Features

- Classification with [RandomForest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)/DecisionTree models
- Classification and on-device learning with [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
- Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using [TinyMaix](https://github.com/sipeed/TinyMaix/) library.
- [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) for feature preprocessing, or general DSP
- Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters for feature preprocessing, or general DSP
- Clustering using K-means
- Scaling and data type transformations for `array`, using `emlearn_arrayutils`.
- Load/save Numpy .npy files using [micropython-npyfile](https://github.com/jonnor/micropython-npyfile/)
- Installable as a MicroPython native module. No rebuild/flashing needed
- Operates on standard `array.array` data structures
- Models can be loaded at runtime from a file in disk/flash
- Highly efficient. Inference times down to 100 microseconds, RAM usage <2 kB, FLASH usage <2 kB
- Pre-built binaries available for most architectures.

## Examples

- [xor_trees](./examples/xor_trees/). A "Hello World", using RandomForest.
- [mnist_cnn](./examples/mnist_cnn/). Basic image classification, using Convolutional Neural Network.
- [har_trees](./examples/har_trees/). Accelerometer-based Human Activity Recognition, using Random Forest
- [soundlevel_iir](./examples/soundlevel_iir/). Sound Level Meter, using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters.

## Documentation

Complete [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://emlearn-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html).

## Prerequisites

Minimally you will need

- Python 3.10+ on host
- MicroPython 1.24+ running onto your device

#### Download repository

Download the repository with examples etc
```
git clone https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython
```

## Usage

Start with the instructions in [XOR example](./examples/xor_trees/).


## Supported versions

At any given point in time, emlearn-micropython only provides pre-built binaries for one MicroPython version.
In general we strongly encourage people to use the latest version.
There are no long-term-support or bugfix versions, at this point.
If you build from source, the current version of emlearn-micropython might also work on a couple of MicroPython versions around the time, but this is not guaranteed.

| MicroPython      | emlearn-micropython  |
|------------------| ------------------   |
| 1.24.x           | master               |
| 1.24.x           | 0.7.0                |
| 1.23.x           | 0.6.0                |

#### Find architecture and .mpy version

The correct .mpy files to use depend on the CPU architecture of your microcontroller,
as well as the MicroPython version.

| MicroPython version | .mpy version  |
|---------------------| ------------- |
| 1.23.x              | 6.3           |
| 1.24.x              | 6.3           |


Identify which CPU architecture your device uses.
You need to specify `ARCH` to install the correct module version.

| ARCH          | Description                       | Examples              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------- |
| x64           | x86 64 bit                        | PC                    |
| x86           | x86 32 bit                        |                       |
| armv6m        | ARM Thumb (1)                     | Cortex-M0             |
| armv7m        | ARM Thumb 2                       | Cortex-M3             |
| armv7emsp     | ARM Thumb 2, single float         | Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M7 |
| armv7emdp     | ARM Thumb 2, double floats        | Cortex-M7             |
| xtensa        | non-windowed                      | ESP8266               |
| xtensawin     | windowed with window size 8       | ESP32                 |

## Benchmarks

#### UCI handwriting digits

UCI ML hand-written digits datasets dataset from
[sklearn.datasets.load_digits](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html).
8x8 image, 64 features. Values are 4-bit integers (16 levels). 10 classes.

Running with a very simple RandomForest, 7 trees.
Reaches approx 86% accuracy.
Tested on Raspberry PI Pico, with RP2040 microcontroller (ARM Cortex M0 @ 133 MHz).

![Inferences per second](./benchmarks/digits_bench.png)

NOTE: over half of the time for emlearn case,
is spent on converting the Python lists of integers into a float array.
Removing that bottleneck would speed up things considerably.


## Developing locally

#### Prerequisites
These come in addition to the prequisites described above.

Make sure you have the dependencies needed to build for your platform.
See [MicroPython: Building native modules](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/natmod.html).

We assume that micropython is installed in the same place as this repository.
If using another location, adjust `MPY_DIR` accordingly.

You should be using MicroPython 1.24 (or newer).

#### Build

Build the .mpy native module
```
make dist ARCH=armv6m MPY_DIR=../micropython
```

Install it on device
```
mpremote cp dist/armv6m*/emlearn_trees.mpy :emlearn_trees.mpy
```

#### Run tests

To build and run tests on host
```
make check
```
