==================================
Getting started with MicroPython
==================================

.. currentmodule:: emlearn

emlearn has dedicated support for `MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_
though `emlearn-micropython <https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython>`_.

It enables using emlearn to get efficient inference,
but by programming only in Python and not having to deal with the underlying C code.

MicroPython supports a wide range of microcontroller devices,
and enables interactive programming.
It also supports modern features such as file-system access, USB mass storage, etc.

Information about the supported ML models and
how to get started, can be found in the `emlearn-micropython README <https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython#readme>`_.
